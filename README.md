# SQL_project

## Project/Goals

Objectives of this project include:

- Loading data into a database.
- Using SQL for data exploration.
- Using SQL for data analysis.
- Utilizing SQL to answer Business Questions with data.


## Process

The first step was loading the database into the SQL server. 
We then cleaned the data and explored the types of data in the database to familiarize ourselves with the kind of information available in the database. 

The second step was finding out what the data could tell us. We did this by using queries that could answer the business questions.


## Results

We discovered that the data could tell us what property types are the most preferred, what percentage of active listings are available, the correlation between different variables such as number of review and review score ratings as well as the maximum and minimum price of the listings. 

To answer these questions we used different queries that extracted the different property types and their ratings from highest to lowest. 

We were also able to calculate the percentage of listings that were available and the ones that were not. 

Additionally, we used  correlation analysis to determine whether review scores taking were affected by the number of reviews left on the listings.

## Challenges

The main challenge that we faced was data cleaning. Some of our results had null values making it difficult to come to a conclusion or rather make sound data analysis.

## Future Goals

If we had more time we would explore more on ways we could clean the data so as to provide accurate results. 
We would also explore more on the relationships between the different data types and how they affect each other, hence get more insights.
